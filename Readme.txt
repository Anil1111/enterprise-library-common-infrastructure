COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE PRE-RELEASE
http://entlibcommon.codeplex.com

This is a pre-release version. It is meant for developers to try out new features or bug fixes ahead of an official release. 
We strongly urge you to only use official builds for production. The latest official release is available at http://msdn.microsoft.com/entlib and via the NuGet official feed (http://nuget.org).

Summary: The Enterprise Library Common assembly contains elements that are shared among multiple application blocks. By supplying a set of commonly used functions to all the application blocks, the Common assembly reduces the dependency of one application block on another.
